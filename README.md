# Blockchain Commons - TypeScript

A comprehensive TypeScript monorepo implementing Blockchain Commons specifications for cryptographic data encoding, uniform resources, and secure information structures.

This repository contains TypeScript implementations of specifications developed by [Blockchain Commons](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/), a research and development cooperative of blockchain and digital asset developers.

## 📦 Packages

### Core Libraries

| Package | Description | Version | Reference |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| [**dcbor**](packages/dcbor) | Deterministic CBOR encoding - a specification for serializing data in a canonical, reproducible format. Ensures identical byte sequences for cryptographic operations and blockchain applications. [📖 API Docs](https://leonardocustodio.github.io/bc-dcbor-ts/) | `1.0.0-alpha.1` | [bc-dcbor-rust](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-dcbor-rust) |
| [**uniform-resources**](packages/uniform-resources) | Uniform Resources (UR) - a method for encoding binary data as URIs for transport in QR codes and other text-based channels. Includes Bytewords encoding and fountain codes for multi-part transmission. | `1.0.0-alpha.1` | [bc-ur-rust](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur-rust) |

## 🎮 Applications

## 📚 Specifications & Reference Implementations

This project implements open specifications maintained by Blockchain Commons:

- **[Deterministic CBOR (dCBOR)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-dcbor-rust)** - A deterministic binary encoding format based on CBOR (RFC 7049)
- **[Uniform Resources (UR)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur-rust)** - A method for encoding binary data as URIs optimized for QR codes and text-based channels
